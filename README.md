Post Impressionist Artist: Paul Cezanne
```
![](IMG_2070.jpg)
This work was inspired by Paul Cezanne's _Still Life with Apples and Pears_. The formalism of his artwork consisted of some elements that I used such as plates, pitcher, and the fruits. The value was low with lots of shading which I added to my work. The techniques used were layering colors to build up surfaces and outlining the forms for emphasis.
Medium: Acryllic paint, colored pencil
