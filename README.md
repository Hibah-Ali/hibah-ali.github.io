### _"The Elemental Dragon"_
![](IMG_2071.jpg)
I created a random pattern in the first piece with blue and yellow acryllic paint. In the second piece I went for an ombre effect with red and blue paint to define the water and fire elements, and drew them in with colored pencil to emphasize this theme. In the third piece, I created two ombre pieces and cut them to create a collage type of piece to bring together all of the elements of design for a finished piece.

Post Impressionist Artist: Paul Cezanne
```
![](IMG_2070.jpg)
This work was inspired by Paul Cezanne's _Still Life with Apples and Pears_. The formalism of his artwork consisted of some elements that I used such as plates, pitcher, and the fruits. The value was low with lots of shading which I added to my work. The techniques used were layering colors to build up surfaces and outlining the forms for emphasis.
Medium: Acryllic paint, colored pencil
